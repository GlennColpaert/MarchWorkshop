## Get Started with MXChip with C

[Get Started with MXChip](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/)

## Advanced Scenario: Azure IoT Hub Python SDK V2

>Note: This is an advanced scenario.  We will host a special focus group from 4-6pm to guide you.  Please consider attending only if you are very proficient in developing IoT applications using Python.

Current [azure-iot-sdk-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python) is a wrapper on [azure-iot-sdk-c](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.  Our customers ran into many installation issues in the past as a result.  We heard the feedback and that's why we have been investing in a native version of the Python SDK.  The source code is located here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python-preview.  If you are a very good Python developer, you can join us from 4-6pm.  We will guide you through the samples and ask for feedback.
